=====================================
2007 10  17 
      Add Situation Exchange & Facility Exchange services.
      Added a  siri_all-v1.2.xsd, ifopt_allStopPlace-v0.3.xsd, acsp_all.xsd packages to force explicit declaration of all elements in an imported namespace on the first reference. This overcomes a limitation of some XML tools that only pick up thos elements on the first import and ignotre all subsequent imports.
